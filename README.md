## Pros and Cons of TDD

### Pros
- Focus on the user and reflects the quality assurance of their experience in
 programmatic form, also good for considering user needs.
- Makes sure that upon the addition of a new feature or refactoring
 that it doesn't introduce new issues or break down a component of the
  architecture.
- By writing unit tests, the programmer is forced to think about and consider
 edge cases or other rare events which are not commonly performed by the user
 . As a byproduct, the developers also gain a better understanding of their
  code while performing TDD.
- Minimizes debugging effort since every new feature is tested before it is
 used or applied to another feature. Also able to identify bugs or issues
  early on rather than near production.

### Cons
- Unit test cases may be curated to just handle the technical requirements
 and may miss some user needs. 
- TDD is a slow and tedious process that delays development time for many
 projects with both simple and complex features. Exhausting all test cases for
  each feature and running the tests on non-trivial data and/or scenarios is
   very time consuming.
- Quality of tests is difficult to determine, as a large amount of effort may
 go into writing trivial test cases that don't provide a wide coverage.
